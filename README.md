# DraftBoard

`draftboard` is a cartesian coordinate based drafting board that can render to SVG and Canvas.
It is useful in creating `drawings` using the cartesian system and it will then automatically
convert to top-left grid used by `SVG` and `HTML Canvas`.

# Shapes

The following simple shapes form the base of `draftboard`:

* Arc
* Circle (also, radial arc)
* Ellipse
* Line
* Polygon
* Polyline
* Rectangle
* Text

These shapes allow us to form complex by composing them in a single `draftboard` such as:

* Marker
* Slice
* Triangle
